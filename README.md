## Project Objective
Our project aims to **classify telecom customers into categories (Churn: Yes / No)** and **cluster similar customers** based on their demographic information and service usage.  
The problem we want to solve: predicting whether a customer will leave the company (churn) or stay, and identifying groups of customers with similar patterns.

## Project Motivation
Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies:  
- Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
- By predicting churn, companies can take proactive actions (offers, improved services, targeted campaigns) to increase retention.  
- Clustering provides insights into customer segments, which helps management and marketing teams design better strategies.  

This problem is both realistic and highly relevant to the industry, making it an excellent case for applying data mining techniques (classification and clustering).
